Error Productions/Explanations

When an error is encountered, cerr is used to output a message after bison
prints "---Syntax Error---". Then, it continues to add children, but it marks
everything from that node to the root as invalid. So if you have 8 varDecs 
and 1 of them is invalid, the program is invalid, but the 7 other varDecs are
still valid. I don't do very much with opening parens/brackets/braces because
they are famous for creating shift-reduce errors in mass. 

I tried to focus on the bigger terms
  1 - Variable Declaration
      -> Missing ';' after identifier
  2 - Constructor Declaration
      -> Incorrect symbol where there should be a left paren
      -> Incorrect symbol where there should be a right paren
  3 - Method Declaration
      -> Missing right paren after paramlist
      
Then went for the second-tier terms
  1 - Statement
      -> Missing ';' after expression
      -> Missing ';' after name dec with paramlist
      -> Missing ')' after paramlist in name dec
      -> Missing ';' after print statement
      -> Missing ')' after arglist for printstatement
      -> Missing ')' after while expression in statement
      -> Missing ';' after return statement
  2 - Local Variable Declaration
      -> Missing ';' after local variable identifier
  3 - Block
      -> Covered by taking care of statement and LocalVarDec
  4 - Expression
      -> Missing ')' after name declaration
      -> Missing ')' after read
      -> Missing '(' after read
      -> Missing ')' after expression
      
Then went for the third-tier
  1 - Conditional Statement 
      -> Missing ')' after expression in conditional statement 
         (with and without else)
  2 - New Expression
      -> Missing ')' after arglist for new expression
      -> Missing ']' after new expression
  3 - Name
      -> Missing ']' after name
      
Between these errors and the errors I carried over from the previous program
(tier 3 and expression), the bases all seemed to be adequately covered. Much 
more than this and it would have been much too cluttered and defeated it's 
own purpose for clearly dictating errors.
